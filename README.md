## Features

- **Pomodoro Mode**: Work in blocks of time to maintain high focus.
- **Focus Timer Mode**: Customizable focus timer for your specific needs.
- **Streak Maintenance**: Keep track of your productivity and stay motivated.

## Recommended IDE Setup

I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) paired with [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for a seamless development experience.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lukebrichey/flow.git

### Development

Start the development server:
